This program is freeware, which means you can download and use it, and also pass it onto other people free of charge, but I retain the copyright.  You may also modify the program for your own use, but you cannot pass on modified copies without my prior permission.

It has been tested on RISC OS 3.11 and 3.71, but does not come with any kind of warranty, i.e. it is supplied "as is" and I am not responsible if it does not work correctly. However I will try to correct any bugs that are found.

Any comments, bug reports or suggestions for improvements are welcome. You can e-mail me, Alex Waugh, at ajw498@ecs.soton.ac.uk
