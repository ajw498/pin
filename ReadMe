Pin Allows you to attach messages to directories, which are shown each
time the directory is opened. Currently up to twenty messages are
supported.
Simply run !PinEdit and change the directories and messages
to whatever you want, and click on Save. You can drag directories to the
window to add their name to the directory icon. The time icon determines
how long the message is shown for.

Then double click on !Pin and your messages will be used.
To quit Pin, from the task manager window (click on the far right icon
on the icon bar) click menu over the task Pin, and select
Task 'Pin' > Quit.
