!Pin Allows you to attach messages to directories, which are shown each time the directory is opened.
Currently up to twenty messages are supported.
Simply run !PinEdit and change the directories and messages to whatever you want, and click on Save.
You can drag directories to the window to add their name to the directory icon.
The time icon determins how long the message is shown for.

Then double click on !Pin and your messages will be used.
To quit !Pin, from the task manager window (click on the Acorn icon on the icon bar) click menu over the task Pin, and select Task 'Pin' > Quit.
